                <h1 class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-title align-left pb-3 display-2">MY STORY<br></h1>
                <h1 class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-text align-left display-7">Thirteen years ago, my husband, two daughters and I spent Thanksgiving with friends down in Washington D.C. Just before I fell asleep that night, I prayed for insight into the complex interpersonal struggles my husband and I were facing. Therapy, arguments, and miscommunication left us both steeped in frustration.  In the early hours of the following morning, everyone in the house was still fast asleep. I awoke from a vivid dream where my husband was no longer who I thought he was. And I had irrevocably changed as well. It was time. An unmistakable feeling of fear ran from my feet all the way up through my body and out my head.<div><br></div><div>Later that day, I asked for a separation. We endured a six-hour drive home in silence and pain. The weeks that followed were heart-wrenching as we privately discussed custody of our children. I would need to go back to work full-time. How would I bear going down to part-time mothering, my girls? I felt utterly unprepared. More importantly, I had very little emotional support outside of my marriage and zero connection with my intuition. My only reference to inner guidance was “The Art of Happiness” by the Dalai Lama and Debbie Ford’s “The Dark Side of the Light Chasers.” I was desperate, and these were my tickets inside.</div><div><br></div><div>I started to wake at 5AM each morning. Through a series of guided meditations, I breathed life into my inner child, who I named MLG which stood for “My Little Girl.” I gave her a desperately needed voice. She would soon take me on all sorts of adventures, showing me her light side and more importantly, the dark so that I could accept her and help her to heal. Many meditations ended with a new realization about who I had been and who I was becoming. More importantly, they addressed a deep fear and sadness that I had been carrying and would need to face in the coming months en route to transitioning to a single parent.</div><div><br></div><div>Following each meditation, I journaled, then drew the feelings. It occurred to me that MLG was telling me a story, so I created paintings to illustrate her adventures about leaving her familiar island for a new city, on a new island. I called the series, "New City" and started to show it at private and local events.</div><div><br></div><div>To say that meditation, visual journaling and painting kept me sane is an understatement. They helped me tap into a subconscious force and internal guidance that I couldn't otherwise access. There were mornings that the sadness I experienced not having my young daughters with me, felt like losing a limb. This pain and witnessing the suffering of the others around me caused me to second guess my decision often. My meditations which gave me access to my subconscious consistently brought me back to center. And if I were patient enough each day, the truth of the situation would reveal itself, and I knew on a gut level that I was doing the right thing. Each morning in my meditation, MLG would unveil a new subconscious element that revealed that leaving my marriage was the only path I could bear. I created the art to honor her and the whole process, it felt sacred. I thought, how can something so beautiful come out of something so painful? This realization increased my trust in myself and my ability to find my way through the most disruptive and agonizing experience of my life, then.</div><div><br></div><div>I needed to match my soon to be ex-husbands earning potential, and I was resistant to dragging out the divorce, fighting for alimony, so I took a job as a Web Designer in Corporate America. Feeling like a square peg in a round hole, I always searched for gratitude in this new corporate culture and found it in my unique ability to financially support my girls independently. I also needed to fill the bottomless pit of loneliness I felt when I didn’t have my girls. I went to DJ school at Scratch Academy in NYC. I studied the Icelandic language. I went skydiving, I got my private pilot’s license, I learned to ride a motorcycle.</div><div><br></div><div>All the while, I continued my practice of meditating, journaling and creating art to access my intuition and inner guidance. What I heard was, “share this knowledge, woman!” Finally, in 2014,  I decided enough was enough. I left Corporate America to complete my undergrad and found my intuition leading me into a Masters Program in Creative Art Therapy so I could deepen and synthesize all that I had already taught myself. I showed up to the part of me that knew which tools I needed now to share and lead others through art to trust themselves and move forward in their lives began bringing art workshops to women and have continued to practice with them in an individual capacity. My vision has been to create a space to allow you to step into your own vulnerability, safely, and teach you the tools that will amplify your voice. Then something amazing happens. You begin to notice how the universe is supporting you, you can no longer ignore your intuition, and you gain momentum on your journey. That is what I offer. Your art will give rise to the stuff that scares you. I have been wrestling with making a new significant change in my life for over a year now. I use journaling to find my voice and art to give it a face. I struggle with speaking up for myself, most often at home. The fear of losing everything by disrupting the status quo is palpable. I’ve been there before.  I created a painting recently that depicts what it felt like to swallow big feelings that need to be shared. After bringing the emotions of life through art, it’s hard to ignore my own truth when I pass the work in my studio! This process moves feelings from within, to the journal and art surface, then they manifest in ways that nudge (or shove me!) me back on my path.</div><div><br></div><div>The beauty through art that arises in the face of pain never ceases to amaze me. And that beauty somehow opens the door for me, again and again, to take myself forward. The tools I'm sharing with you will re-connect you to your core self and to what you already know!  The art you discover within yourself and express will lead you forward in your own life where you have been stuck, not trusting yourself or holding back.</div><div><br></div><div>Our creative process brings us to tap into what we already know about ourselves. We have an incredible intuition and sacred knowledge available that leads us through obscure and complicated life work. Just like me, your own intuition is waiting for you to be accessed it through art so you can move your life forward with trust and strength.</div><div><br><div><br></div><div><br></div></div></h1>
